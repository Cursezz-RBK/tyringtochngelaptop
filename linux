{{{{{ NOTE : Disk (Physical stroage unit ) is divided into no of Partition (Sub-division of disk),
            Within a partition inorder to store & install some application we need file system (It's more like a layer within partition for storage),
            A partition can have only one file system, The file system is later divided into directories for file storage
            Connecting a file system with another file system is done through a directory (which act like a bridge),
			The process of this connection is called mounting and that directory is called mount point }}}}}
  
*] du -h /dir/.. (disk usage) -> It is used to estimate and report the amount of disk space used by files and directories.

*] mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb -> Where, /dev/sdb1 is File system & /mnt/usb is the directory in which it gets mounted.

*] umount <mount_point> -> Unmounting a file system disconnects it from the file system hierarchy, making it inaccessible.

Network :
-------

{{{{{ A network interface is the point of connection between a computer and a network,
      Once an connection is established to network an Ip address is assigned to the device, so that we can identify a device's location and
	  network interface for transmission. A port is an endpoint of an application or a process within a device,
	  which is connected to network interface and then to Internet, By using different port multiple applications of same device can connect internet.
	  Port and Ip address combindly known as Socket.
	  A network connection refers to the established link between two devices that allows data transfer, This connection utilizes both
	  the IP address and port number to route data correctly. }}}}}
	  
*] iptables -L -> It is a Powerful Firewall Tool, used to configure the Linux kernel firewall, known as Netfilter. It allows you to define rules
                  for how network packets are handled, providing control over incoming and outgoing traffic at kernal level.

       designed to simplify the complex task of managing iptables rules.

*] ping <ip_address> -> It is a Network diagnostic tool, used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

*] ifconfig -> Also known as Interface configuration is used to configure and manage network interfaces.
               It allows users to view and modify network settings, including assigning IP addresses, enabling or disabling interfaces,
			   and displaying network configuration information.
			   
*] route -> This command is a powerful tool used to manage routing tables in Linux systems. It allows you to view, add, and delete routes,
            which determine how packets are forwarded to their destinations.
			
*] traceroute <IP> -> traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that traces the route a packet takes from your computer to a destination host.

*] ip -> The ip command is designed to handle various networking tasks, including configuring network interfaces, managing IP addresses,
         and manipulating routing tables. It allows system administrators to view and modify network settings in real-time without
		 needing to reboot the system.

*] find -> It is a Powerful File Search Tool, used to search for files and directories within a specified directory hierarchy.

*] Hard link -> A hard link is essentially a second name for an existing file. It points directly to the same inode
               (data structure that describes a file) as the original file.
			 -> Usage - "ln original_file hard_link"  
   Soft link -> A soft link, also known as a symbolic link or symlink, is a file that points to another file or directory.
                It's like a shortcut on Windows
             -> Usage - "ln -s original_file soft_link"

Concepts :
--------

*] Log directories ->		  
	/var/log: This is the primary directory for system logs.
	/var/log/messages: General system messages.
	/var/log/syslog: System messages (older systems).
	/var/log/secure: Security-related logs (e.g., SSH, sudo).
	/var/log/cron.log: Cron job logs.
	/var/log/apache2: Apache web server logs.
	/var/log/nginx: Nginx web server logs.
	/var/log/samba: Samba file server logs.
	/var/log/mysql: MySQL database server logs.
	
*] File system ->
	/ : root directory
	/bin: Contains essential binary executables for all users.   
	/boot: Contains boot loader files and kernel images.   
	/dev: Contains device files representing hardware devices.   
	/etc: Contains system configuration files.   
	/home: Contains user home directories. 
	/var: Variable files, including log files and spool directories.  
	/lib: Contains shared libraries.   
	/mnt: Mount point for temporary file systems.   
	/opt: Optional software packages.   
	/root: Root user's home directory.   
	/sbin: Contains essential system binaries, typically used by root.   
	/tmp: Temporary files.   
	/usr: Contains user programs and libraries.
	/var: Variable files, including log files and spool directories.   

*] yum -> Used in Red Hat-based distributions like RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.
   apt -> Used in Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu and Debian
   rpm -> Used in RPM-based distributions
   
*] Options to Log into a Server When SSH Fails :
   -> IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) -> This interface provides remote management capabilities, including remote console access
      and power control.
	  -> ILOM (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a hardware-based management interface found in many server-class systems,
	     especially those from HP. It provides remote management capabilities, allowing administrators to monitor, configure, and
		 control server hardware remotely.
   -> SSH Tunneling - Use SSH to create a secure tunnel for other protocols like HTTP or RDP.
   -> RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
   -> Direct Console Access  

*] Upgrading a Linux system without internet access requires a different approach. Traditional package managers like apt, yum, or dnf rely on
   online repositories to download and install updates.
   -> Linux repo mount, then upgrade.
   -> Offline Repository -> 
	  Download Packages : Use a system with internet access to download the required packages and their dependencies.
      Transfer Packages : Transfer the downloaded packages to the offline system using a USB drive, network share, or other methods.   
      Create a Local Repository : Create a local repository on the offline system and add the downloaded packages to it.
      Install Packages : Use the package manager to install packages from the local repository.
