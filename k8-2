KUBERNETES :


1]	Docker are ephemeral in nature.
	Kubernetes is an opensource system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

2]	Kubernetes solves Docker's issues :

	a] One host machine (When one container consumes more resources, it affects other containers)
	--> In production, k8 is installed in master-cluster architecture. Hence, when meet with resource issues, the application is moved into different pods.
	
	b] Auto-Healing
	--> Whenever an container goes down a new pod/container is rolled out/created.
	
	c] Auto-Scaling & Load-Balancing
	--> We can confiure in manifest file (yaml file), that new container can be started, when 80% threshold is reached.
	
	d] Docker doesn't support enterprise level supports (Firewall,Auto-Healing,Auto-Scaling,API-Gateways,etc,...)
	--> Active community to support k8 (CNCF)

3] Docker Container's have container runtime component called Docker shim.
	
4] Architecture :

	a] Request (1)
	
	b] Master Node / Controller plan (2) :
	
	1] API Server - Which exposes the k8 to external world and determines which application to which node (based on the requests)
	2] Shedular - Based on info from API, It shedules the pods in nodes
	3] etcd - It is where Key-Value information of Cluster-Node was stored
	4] Controller manager - Which manages all the controller (Replicaset controller - Used in Auto-Scaling)
	5] Cloud controller manager - Only when using Cloud, inorder to interact with cloud provider's services
	
	
	c] Worker Node / Data plan (3) :
	
	1] Kube-proxy - Which deals with networking related activities (assigning ip address to the pods, etc)
	2] Kubelet - Responsible foe creating pods, It also reports if any issues in the pods
	3] Container runtime - Unlike docker's container runtime (Docker shim), Here we can use Docker shim, Containerd, etc,...
	
5] Having Multi containers in single pod have the following advantage:

	a] Shared network
	b] Shared Storage
	
6]	Docker -> run container -> using runtime commands (with -p, -v, etc,...)
	K8 -> run pods -> usong .yaml files (In which we give container runtime command specifications)
